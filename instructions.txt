Note: In most cases the agent manages to complete the first level, 
but there are some cases where it gets stuck and dies before it can clear all pellets

In order to run the game:

Navigate to the "Pacman" folder in a shell of your choice 
(Make sure python, numpy, and pygame are installed)

Then run the command 'python run.py' in the shell and watch Pacman play itself

Alternatively: Open the project in an IDE and execute run.py using an appropriate 
python interpreter
